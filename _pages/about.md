I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [AI-augmented Simulation group](https://www.iisb.fraunhofer.de/en/research_areas/simulation/ai-augmented-simulation.html) at [Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems and Device Technology IISB](https://www.iisb.fraunhofer.de) in Erlangen (Germany). My research focuses on scientific machine learning, in particular,
<ul>
  <li>physics-informed machine learning and its industrial applications,</li>
  <li>methodological improvements of physics-informed neural networks.</li>
</ul>
I have a background in mathematics, where I obtained my PhD in March 2024 under the joint supervision of [Gerhard Rein](https://www.diffgleichg.uni-bayreuth.de/en/team/prof-rein/) (University of Bayreuth) and [Mahir Hadžić](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahadz) (University College London). My doctoral research was focused on the analysis of partial differential equations from galactic dynamics using mathematical and numerical methods. Concretely, I worked on
<ul>
  <li>proving the existence of damped and pulsating galaxies,</li>
  <li>studying the stability of star clusters in general relativity,</li>
  <li>simulating non-linear PDE systems numerically via high-performance computing in C++.</li>
</ul>
