I recently completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics and am currently working as a researcher at the University of Bayreuth. My research focuses on the mathematical analysis of differential equations from astrophysics and their simulation using high-performance computing in C++. Additionally, I possess expertise in AI, including Deep Learning and NLP, which I apply in my astromathematical research and in cross-disciplinary research projects.
