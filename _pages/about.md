I am a researcher at the [AI-augmented Simulation group](https://www.iisb.fraunhofer.de/en/research_areas/simulation/ai-augmented-simulation.html) at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems and Device Technology IISB](https://www.iisb.fraunhofer.de) in Erlangen (Germany). I am leading the institute’s research activities on scientific machine learning, focusing on 
<ul>
  <li>physics-informed machine learning and its industrial applications,</li>
  <li>methodological improvements of physics-informed neural networks.</li>
</ul>
My work on physics-informed neural networks and operators spans diverse industry-relevant applications, including semiconductor process simulations, lithography, and plastic deformation. 

I have a background in mathematics, where I obtained my PhD in March 2024 under the joint supervision of [Gerhard Rein](https://www.diffgleichg.uni-bayreuth.de/en/team/prof-rein/) (University of Bayreuth) and [Mahir Hadžić](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahadz) (University College London). My doctoral research was focused on the analysis of partial differential equations from galactic dynamics using mathematical and numerical methods.
