I am a researcher at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Bayreuth. My main research interests currently include
<ul>
  <li>applications of physics-informed neural networks</li>
  <li>applications of geometric deep learning for automating control cabinet assembly.</li>
</ul>
My background is in applied mathematics, where I obtained my PhD in 2024 under the supervision of [Gerhard Rein](https://www.diffgleichg.uni-bayreuth.de/en/team/prof-rein/) and [Mahir Hadžić](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahadz). My doctoral research was focused on the analysis of partial differential equations arising in astromathematics. In particular, I worked on
<ul>
  <li>proving the existence of linearly damped and pulsating galaxies,</li>
  <li>studying the stability of star clusters in general relativity,</li>
  <li>analyzing (the spectrum of) differential operators,</li>
  <li>simulating non-linear PDE systems numerically via high-performance computing in C++.</li>
</ul>
