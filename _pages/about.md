I am a Senior Scientist at the [AI-augmented Simulation group](https://www.iisb.fraunhofer.de/en/research_areas/simulation/ai-augmented-simulation.html) at [Fraunhofer IISB](https://www.iisb.fraunhofer.de) in Erlangen (Germany). I am leading the research activities on Scientific Machine Learning, focusing on 
<ul>
  <li>Physics-Informed Machine Learning and its industrial applications,</li>
  <li>methodological improvements of Physics-Informed Neural Networks.</li>
</ul>
My work spans diverse industry-relevant applications, including semiconductor process simulations, lithography, battery modelling, and plastic deformation.

I have a background in mathematics, where I obtained my PhD in March 2024. My doctoral research was focused on the analysis of partial differential equations arising in galactic dynamics using mathematical and numerical methods.
