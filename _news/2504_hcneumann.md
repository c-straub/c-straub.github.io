My first scientific machine learning paper <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=jKdZsWdRLZ">Hard-constraining Neumann boundary conditions in physics-informed neural networks via Fourier feature embeddings</a> has been accepted at the <a href="https://multiscale-ai.github.io/">ICLR 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning Multiscale Processes</a>.
