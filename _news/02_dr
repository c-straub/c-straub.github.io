After successfully defending my thesis <a href="https://doi.org/10.15495/EPub_UBT_00007639">Pulsating Galaxies</a> on March 13th 2024, I am excited to share that I have now completed my PhD! Particularly honoured to have received the best possible grade "summa cum laude" (0 on the German grading scale) and that an Ivy League professor describes my work in his report as "the strongest thesis in the field in recent years". Grateful to everyone who supported me on this journey over the last years, especially to my excellent advisors <a href="https://www.diffgleichg.uni-bayreuth.de/de/team/prof-rein/">Gerhard Rein</a> (from Bayreuth) and <a href="https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahadz/">Mahir Hadžić</a> (from UCL).
